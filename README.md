# Assignment 2: Query Drift Arena

Rerank a provided top-K candidate list with your own unigram language
model, then build an RM1/RM2/RM3 relevance-feedback layer on top of it —
and survive the harness quietly feeding that feedback function a
noise-contaminated pseudo-relevant seed. See the assignment spec
(`assignment2_query_drift_arena.docx`/`.pdf` in the course materials) for
the full writeup; this README is quickstart + repo map only.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
python -m harness.run_harness \
  --corpus data/toy/corpus.jsonl \
  --queries data/toy/queries_dev.tsv \
  --qrels data/toy/qrels_dev.txt \
  --candidates data/toy/candidates_dev.jsonl \
  --run-out runs/dev_run.trec \
  --report-out runs/dev_report.json
```

Or just run `bash scripts/smoke_test.sh`, which does all three.

## What you edit

Only `submission/feedback.py` (and, optionally,
`submission/adversarial_set.json` for the bonus track — see
`docs/GRADING.md`). Everything under `harness/` is read-only reference
code shared by every submission; it is what actually scores you, so
reading it (especially `harness/leaderboard.py` and
`harness/noise_injection.py`) is worth your time.

## Differences from Assignment 1, at a glance

- **You never build an index or rank the whole corpus.** Every retrieval
  call is scoped to a PROVIDED candidate pool (`candidate_doc_ids`,
  typically ~100 documents from an undisclosed reference retriever — see
  `docs/GRADING.md`) — not `data/toy/corpus.jsonl` or `data/full/corpus.jsonl`
  at large. `prepare()` still reads the whole corpus once for cheap,
  one-time collection-wide statistics; nothing after that is O(corpus)
  per query. This is deliberate: Assignment 1 already covered
  "efficiently rank a whole corpus" — this assignment is about the
  language model and the relevance-feedback layer, not indexing.
- No Docker image, no build/load process split — `prepare()` and both
  retrieval functions run in-process, called directly by
  `run_harness.py`. See `docs/SUBMISSION_INTERFACE.md`.
- Two required retrieval functions instead of one (`score_candidates()`
  and `relevance_model_feedback()`), scored on three tracks instead of a
  single accuracy metric plus efficiency/size modifiers — see the
  assignment spec, Section 7.
- A public, unit-tested "practice" noise-injection recipe you can sweep
  locally (`harness/noise_injection.py`) — the real grading recipe is
  undisclosed, same secrecy principle as Assignment 1's held-out topics.
- An optional bonus track (`submission/adversarial_set.json`) that is
  genuinely head-to-head against the rest of the class, not just a shared
  leaderboard climb.

## My submission (what is implemented)

`submission/feedback.py` (+ `submission/text_utils.py`), standard library only:

- **Analysis:** lowercase alphanumeric tokens and a from-scratch Porter stemmer for docs and queries. Stopwords are removed from queries and expansion terms only.
- **`score_candidates()`:** unigram query likelihood with Dirichlet smoothing, μ = 3 × average doc length. Jelinek-Mercer is available via `SMOOTHING="jm"`.
- **`relevance_model_feedback()`:** RM1, RM2 (Lavrenko & Croft's iid-sampling form) and RM3, selected with `RM_VARIANT`.
  - Seed weights are `P(D|Q)`, computed from each call's own seed.
  - The top 45 expansion terms are kept.
  - Candidates are ranked by cross-entropy against the Dirichlet-smoothed doc models.
  - Defaults: RM3 over RM1, λ = 0.5 on the original query, and expansion terms must appear in at least 2 seed docs.
- **Tests:** `tests/test_feedback_correctness.py` checks QL, RM1, RM2 and RM3 against hand-computed values on a 3-doc corpus.

### Reproducing the tuning

```bash
python scripts/build_cranfield_proxy.py          # Cranfield + our own BM25 top-100 -> data/cranfield/
python scripts/sweep.py ql --data data/cranfield --out runs/ql.csv
python scripts/sweep.py fb --data data/cranfield --variants rm1,rm2,rm3 \
    --lambdas 0,0.2,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.8,1.0 --levels 0.25,0.5,0.75 --out runs/fb.csv
python scripts/build_adversarial_set.py --data data/full   # bonus set; needs the real dev candidates
```

All scripts take `--data`. Point them at `data/full` once the staff `candidates_dev.jsonl` is released.

### TREC-COVID without ir_datasets

If the BEIR/HuggingFace hosts are unreachable, run:

```bash
python scripts/build_trec_covid.py                                        # CORD-19 2020-07-16 + BEIR topics/qrels -> data/full/
python scripts/build_cranfield_proxy.py --candidates-only --out data/full  # stand-in BM25 top-100 pools
```

The results are in `experiments/trec_covid/`.
